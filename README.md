The Next Board, simple digital presence-board.


A very simple **Angularjs/Firebase/Bootstrap** webapp, based on the original
*AngularFire-Seed* project, to manage a virtual presence board like the ones
that are commonly used in several companies to check who is at the office.

You need to define your Firebase reference in the *app/js/config.js* file.
Remember to enable the SimpleLogin *EMail/Password* authentication to access
the configuration pages.
